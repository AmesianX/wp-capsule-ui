## Things to do

1. After restoring a "trashed" post, the post breaks on meta data, needs a fix.
2. Using the anchor or star icon to make something sticky freezes the loading graphic, needs a fix.
3. Search needs a plug in to do predictive look ups and to be able to change context of search between everything, projects and tags.
4. An advance search page needs to be created to allow users to search by complex criteria.
5. Flyout menus, from an example like "projects", need to be wired up. A "view all projects" page needs to be designed.
6. Style needs to be set for the editor view as a default product. This could be as simple as picking a theme or creating a new one.
7. New Post needs to be wired to work, currently it reverts back to the admin page.
8. A way to go from "content view" back to "exerpt view" needs to be accomplished.
9. A plugin and style for global messaging needs to be added. ex. "Server is down for maintance"
